Recent advancement of Bitcoin revolution has propelled unlimited opportunities for futuristic digital ecosystem design. Transactions belonging to Bitcoin are being fully supported, realized, and disseminated by a set of innovative hot and cold wallet technologies within the blockchain framework. While deploying smart applications under the niche of Internet of Things (IoT) plethora, such Bitcoin transactions aroused the issue of unsupported resource-constrained tool sets and demanded for a novel architecture. To cater this challenge, this article proposes a novel Bitcoin lightweight IoT node-based system model while incorporating the improved simplified payment verification (SPV) process for e-healthcare application. This article, first formulates necessary models of background arts utilized in the work that include inhomogeneous Poisson point process, block header structure formulation, depth and height relationship, bloom filter mechanism, pay-to-public key hash (P2PKH) base stack process, and transaction management. Second, developed models are deployed through several key algorithms and associated procedures. Finally, analysis and discussions are made that encompass the block confirmation time, appropriateness of the byzantine fault tolerance, smart contract policy, and SPV response in the proposed scenario.

This article dealt with the problem about how the IoT-based
resource-constrained facilities could be integrated with the proposed BLWN system model to materialize the e-healthcare application. The proposed study leveraged a novel SPV mechanism
for countering the e-healthcare aspect under IoT-based orientation. The results show that under current circumstance, IoT can
be well conjunctional with the proposed Bitcoin faucet-enabled
BLWN notions while showing relevant improvement in the
usage policy for the byzantine fault tolerance algorithms and
confirmation times.
